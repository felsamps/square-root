SUARE ROOT DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION

Solutions to be Designed:

*	S0 - Purely behavorial VHDL implementation (bordeline solution)
*	S1 - FSMD (highly possible parallelism using as HW resources as necessary 
*	S2 - Low Cost Solution: using one adder operator
*	S3 - Latch-based solution: using one adder operator and clock gating
	S4 - One-bit-adder solution: using shift registers
	S5 - Hash memory implementation
	S6 - 4 one-bit-adder operators (like S4)
*	S7 - Bit level parallelism (S6 as basis and using a pipeline scheme) 
*	S8 - Fully combinational
* S9 - SW Pipeline
	S10 - Optimized Hash Memory Implementation
	S11 - Linear Search Multiplier Solution
	S12 - Binary Search Multiplier Solution
*	S13 - Dynamic Programming Multiplier Solution

*these solutions will certainly be implemented
